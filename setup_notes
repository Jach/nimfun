Installed nim from github, then installed nimble (nim package manager)
nim install sdl2
(Also had to get sdl2 from portage)
Installed nim plugin for vim. OmniComplete works nicely,
added 
map \ngt :tab split<CR>:call JumpToDef()<CR>
(\ nim go tab) to open defs in new tabs like I like.
Not a fan of the rubyesque no-parens-needed for function calls, but whatever.
